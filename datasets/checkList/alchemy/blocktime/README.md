Block timestamps have been used historically for a number of purposes, including entropy for random numbers locking funds for a set amount of time, and different state-changing, time-dependent conditional statements. Because validators have the capacity to slightly alter timestamps, using block timestamps wrong in smart contracts can be quite risky.

The time difference between events can be estimated using block.number and the average block time. However, because block times can change and break functionality, it's best to avoid its use.
