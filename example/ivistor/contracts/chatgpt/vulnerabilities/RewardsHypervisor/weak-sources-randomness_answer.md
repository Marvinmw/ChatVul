### Vulnerability Type
Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes

### Vulnerability Description
The smart contract uses the `block.timestamp` attribute to generate pseudo-random values for fairness. However, this can be manipulated by miners to generate many alternative blocks, only choosing the block that will result in a jackpot for the miner. 

### Recommendation
To avoid miner manipulation in random number generation, the contract should use a commitment scheme such as RANDAO, a DAO where the random number is generated by all participants in the DAO, or external sources via oracles, e.g. Oraclize. Using Bitcoin block hashes is also an option, as the network is more decentralized and blocks are more expensive to mine.
