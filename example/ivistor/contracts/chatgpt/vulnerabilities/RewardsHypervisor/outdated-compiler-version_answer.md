## Vulnerability Report

### Outdated Compiler Version

The smart contract uses an outdated compiler version `0.7.6`. The latest version of the Solidity compiler is `0.8.7`. Using an outdated compiler version can lead to vulnerabilities and bugs that have already been fixed in the latest version. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to steal funds or cause other damage to the smart contract. It is recommended to use the latest version of the Solidity compiler to ensure that the smart contract is secure and free from known vulnerabilities.

### Unprotected Function Visibility

The `isContract` function is marked as private, but it does not return the `isContract` variable. This means that the function can be called by anyone on the network, and it will always return `false`. This can be exploited by attackers to bypass the `if` statement in the `deposit` function and execute the `else` statement, which transfers tokens to the contract without checking if the sender is a contract or not. To fix this vulnerability, the `isContract` function should return the `isContract` variable and the `deposit` function should check the return value of the `isContract` function before executing the `if` statement.

### Conclusion

The smart contract has one critical vulnerability and one warning. The critical vulnerability is the use of an outdated compiler version, which can lead to known vulnerabilities and bugs. The warning is the unprotected function visibility, which can be exploited by attackers to bypass the `if` statement in the `deposit` function. It is recommended to update the compiler version to the latest version and fix the unprotected function visibility to ensure that the smart contract is secure and free from known vulnerabilities.
