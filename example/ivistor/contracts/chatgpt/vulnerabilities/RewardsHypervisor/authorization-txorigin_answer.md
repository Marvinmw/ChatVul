### Authorization Through tx.origin

The new smart contract code does not contain any direct use of `tx.origin` for authorization. Instead, it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions. This modifier checks if the caller is the owner of the contract and only allows them to execute the function. This is a safer way to implement authorization as it relies on the `msg.sender` variable, which cannot be manipulated by other contracts.

### Other Potential Issues

The `isContract` function is used to check if an address is a contract or not. However, this function does not need to be public as it is only used internally. Making it public could allow an attacker to determine if a specific address is a contract or not, which could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities.

There are no other potential issues found in the new smart contract code.
