## Vulnerability Report

### Inadherence to Standards

The smart contract code follows the standards and imports the required libraries. There are no issues with adherence to standards.

### Function Visibility

All the functions in the smart contract are externally visible. It is recommended to keep the functions as private as possible to reduce the attack surface. 

### isContract Function

The `isContract` function is used to check if an address is a contract or not. The function uses inline assembly to get the size of the code at the given address. Although the function works as expected, it is not necessary to use inline assembly for this purpose. The same functionality can be achieved using the `extcodesize` function provided by Solidity. 

### Conclusion

The smart contract code is well-written and follows the standards. However, the functions can be made private to reduce the attack surface. The `isContract` function can be simplified by using the `extcodesize` function provided by Solidity. There are no major vulnerabilities found in the smart contract code.
