### Signature Malleability

The new smart contract code is not vulnerable to signature malleability because it does not use cryptographic signatures to verify previously signed messages. Therefore, there is no possibility of malicious users finding the signature and recreating it.

### Other Issues

There are no other apparent vulnerabilities in the new smart contract code. However, it is worth noting that the `isContract` function is not marked as `pure` or `view`, even though it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, it would be more efficient to mark it as `view`.
