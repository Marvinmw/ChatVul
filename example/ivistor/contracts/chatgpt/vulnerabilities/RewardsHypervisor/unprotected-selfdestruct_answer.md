### Unprotected Selfdestruct Instruction

The new smart contract code is not vulnerable to the Unprotected Selfdestruct Instruction vulnerability.

Reasoning: The `selfdestruct` method is not used in the new code, and there are no missing or insufficient access controls that could allow a malicious actor to self-destruct the contract. Therefore, this vulnerability is not applicable to the new code.
