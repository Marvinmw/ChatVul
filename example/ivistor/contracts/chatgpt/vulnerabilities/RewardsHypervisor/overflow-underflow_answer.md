## Report

### Integer Overflow and Underflow

The new smart contract code is free from integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. The code uses SafeMath library to avoid over/underflows. The SafeMath library is built in by default in Solidity >=v0.8.0. Therefore, the code is safe from integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. 

### Conclusion

The new smart contract code is safe from integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
