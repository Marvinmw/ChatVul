### Vulnerability Type: Requirement Violation

### Vulnerable Lines: 

The following lines are vulnerable to requirement violation:

```
require(from == msg.sender || IVisor(from).owner() == msg.sender, "Sender must own the tokens");
```

### Explanation:

The `require()` statement is used to validate the condition that the sender must own the tokens. However, the `IVisor(from).owner()` function call can return an invalid value if the `from` address is not a valid contract address. This can happen if the `from` address is a regular user address. In this case, the `IVisor(from).owner()` function call will return the default value of the `owner` variable, which is the zero address. As a result, the `require()` statement will fail, even though the sender owns the tokens.

### Recommendation:

To fix this issue, the `isContract()` function should be modified to return `false` for regular user addresses. This can be done by adding the following check at the beginning of the function:

```
if (_addr == address(0)) {
    return false;
}
```

This will ensure that the function returns `false` for the zero address, which is not a contract address. The `isContract()` function should also be marked as `view` to indicate that it does not modify the state of the contract.

```
function isContract(address _addr) private view returns (bool isContract){
    if (_addr == address(0)) {
        return false;
    }
    uint32 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(_addr)
    }
    return (size > 0);
}
```
