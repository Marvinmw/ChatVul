There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the new smart contract code. The code uses SafeMath and SafeERC20 libraries to prevent integer overflow and reentrancy attacks. The deposit and withdraw functions have appropriate checks for input parameters and ownership. The isContract function is used to check if the sender is a contract or not. Overall, the code follows best practices for secure smart contract development.
