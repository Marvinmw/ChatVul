## Report

### Arbitrary Jump with Function Type Variable

The code does not contain any vulnerable code related to this vulnerability. Therefore, the code is safe from this vulnerability.

### Details

This vulnerability is related to the use of function types in Solidity. If the smart contract uses certain assembly instructions, an attacker may be able to point the function variable to any other function. This may give the attacker the ability to break the functionality of the contract, and perhaps even drain the contract funds. However, the code does not use any assembly instructions or function types that can be manipulated by an attacker. Therefore, the code is safe from this vulnerability.

### Conclusion

The code is safe from the Arbitrary Jump with Function Type Variable vulnerability.
