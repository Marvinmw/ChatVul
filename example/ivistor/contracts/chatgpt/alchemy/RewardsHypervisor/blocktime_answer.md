## Report

### Timestamp Dependency Vulnerability

The new smart contract code does not contain any direct use of block timestamps, so there is no timestamp dependency vulnerability.

### Other Potential Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Missing Visibility Modifier

The `isContract` function in the `RewardsHypervisor` contract is missing a visibility modifier. By default, functions are set to `public`, which means that anyone can call them. In this case, the function is only used internally, so it should be set to `private` to prevent external access.

#### 2. Missing SafeMath Library

The `deposit` function in the `RewardsHypervisor` contract uses the `mul` function to calculate shares, but the `SafeMath` library is not imported or used to prevent integer overflow/underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. The `SafeMath` library should be imported and used for all arithmetic operations involving user input.

#### 3. Missing Input Validation

The `withdraw` function in the `RewardsHypervisor` contract does not validate the `to` address before transferring tokens to it. This can lead to tokens being sent to an invalid or unintended address. The function should validate that the `to` address is not zero before transferring tokens.

#### 4. Missing Access Control

The `isContract` function in the `RewardsHypervisor` contract is used to check if an address is a contract or not. However, there is no access control on this function, so anyone can call it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. The function should be set to `internal` to prevent external access.

### Recommendations

1. Add a visibility modifier to the `isContract` function to prevent external access.
2. Import and use the `SafeMath` library for all arithmetic operations involving user input.
3. Validate the `to` address before transferring tokens in the `withdraw` function.
4. Set the `isContract` function to `internal` to prevent external access.
