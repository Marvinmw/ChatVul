### Vulnerability Report

#### Race Condition

The new smart contract code does not contain any race condition vulnerability.

#### Reentrancy

The new smart contract code does not contain any reentrancy vulnerability.

#### Integer Overflow/Underflow

The new smart contract code does not contain any integer overflow/underflow vulnerability.

#### DoS with Block Gas Limit

The new smart contract code does not contain any DoS with block gas limit vulnerability.

#### Unprotected Ether Withdrawal

The new smart contract code does not contain any unprotected ether withdrawal vulnerability.

#### Access Control

The new smart contract code contains an access control vulnerability in the `isContract` function. The function is marked as private, but it does not contain the `view` modifier. This means that the function can modify the state of the contract, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `isContract` function should be marked as `view`.

```Solidity
function isContract(address _addr) private view returns (bool isContract){
    uint32 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(_addr)
    }
    return (size > 0);
}
```

#### Floating-Point Approximation and Comparison

The new smart contract code does not contain any floating-point approximation and comparison vulnerability.

#### Denial of Service with Failed Call

The new smart contract code does not contain any denial of service with failed call vulnerability.

#### Missing Function Visibility

The new smart contract code does not contain any missing function visibility vulnerability.

#### Uninitialized Storage Pointer

The new smart contract code does not contain any uninitialized storage pointer vulnerability.

#### Shadowing State Variables

The new smart contract code does not contain any shadowing state variables vulnerability.

#### External Contract Reference

The new smart contract code does not contain any external contract reference vulnerability.

#### Conclusion

The new smart contract code contains one access control vulnerability, which can be fixed by adding the `view` modifier to the `isContract` function.
