Vulnerability Type: Unchecked External Call

In the `deposit` function, there is an external call to `IVisor(from).delegatedTransferERC20`, which is not checked for success. If this call fails, the contract will continue execution as if the call succeeded, which could result in buggy and potentially exploitable behavior from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the developer should add a check to ensure that the external call succeeded before continuing execution. This can be done using the `require` statement, as follows:

```
require(IVisor(from).delegatedTransferERC20(address(visr), address(this), visrDeposit), "external call failed");
```

This will cause the contract to revert if the external call fails, preventing buggy behavior and potential exploits.
