## Report

### Vulnerability

The new smart contract code does not contain any vulnerabilities.

### Explanation

The new smart contract code is a modified version of the ERC777 token standard. The code is well-written and follows best practices for secure smart contract development. The code uses the `require` statement to check for conditions that must be met before executing a function. This helps to prevent errors and malicious behavior.

The code also uses the `internal` and `private` access modifiers to restrict access to certain functions and variables. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract state.

Overall, the new smart contract code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities.

### Recommendation

No recommendations for this code.
