## Report

### Integer Overflow and Underflow

#### Details

In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, an integer would automatically roll over to a lower or higher number. If you decremented 0 by 1 (0-1) on an unsigned number, the outcome would simply be: MAX instead of -1 or an error. 

#### Example

There are no instances of integer overflow or underflow in the new code.

### Access Control

#### Details

Access control vulnerabilities arise when smart contracts do not properly restrict access to sensitive functions or data. 

#### Example

The `n00dToken` contract inherits from the `ERC777` contract, which implements access control measures such as `isOperatorFor`, `authorizeOperator`, and `revokeOperator`. These functions ensure that only authorized operators can perform certain actions, such as sending or burning tokens. 

However, the `n00dToken` contract does not implement any additional access control measures beyond those inherited from `ERC777`. This means that anyone who can call the `n00dToken` contract's functions can perform any action that is not restricted by `ERC777`. 

For example, anyone can call the `transfer` function to transfer tokens from one address to another, even if they are not authorized to do so. 

### Recommendations

To address the access control vulnerability, the `n00dToken` contract should implement additional access control measures beyond those inherited from `ERC777`. For example, the contract could restrict certain functions to specific addresses or roles, or require multi-factor authentication for sensitive actions. 

Additionally, the contract should be thoroughly tested to ensure that all access control measures are functioning as intended.
