There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the new smart contract code. The code implements the ERC777 token standard and includes various functions for transferring tokens, managing allowances, and authorizing operators. The contract also includes a reentrancy guard in the form of a noReentrant modifier, which prevents reentrancy attacks by locking the contract during function execution. Overall, the code appears to be well-written and secure.
