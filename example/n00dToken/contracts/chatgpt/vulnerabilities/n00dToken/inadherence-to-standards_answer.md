## Vulnerability Report

### Inadherence to Standards

The new smart contract code adheres to the ERC777 standard, which is an improvement over the previous code that did not follow any standard. Therefore, there are no vulnerabilities related to this issue in the new code.

### Reentrancy

The new smart contract code does not have any functions that call external contracts, so there are no reentrancy vulnerabilities in the code.

### Arithmetic

The new smart contract code does not have any arithmetic operations, so there are no arithmetic vulnerabilities in the code.

### Denial of Service

The new smart contract code does not have any loops or recursive functions, so there are no denial of service vulnerabilities in the code.

### Access Control

The new smart contract code has functions that use the `require` statement to check for conditions before executing the function. This ensures that only authorized users can execute the functions. However, the `authorizeOperator` and `revokeOperator` functions do not check if the operator being authorized or revoked is a valid address. This could allow an attacker to authorize or revoke an operator for an invalid address, which could cause unexpected behavior in the contract. To fix this vulnerability, the `authorizeOperator` and `revokeOperator` functions should check if the operator address is valid before executing the function.

### Integer Overflow and Underflow

The new smart contract code does not have any arithmetic operations, so there are no integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities in the code.

### Unchecked Return Value

The new smart contract code does not have any external function calls that return a value, so there are no unchecked return value vulnerabilities in the code.

### Other Issues

There are no other issues found in the new smart contract code.
