[["transaction-ordering-dependence", "\n\n## Vulnerability Report\n\n### Description\n\nThe smart contract code is vulnerable to transaction-ordering dependence. The `_mint` function is called in the constructor of the `n00dToken` contract, which mints tokens to the `msg.sender`. Since the `_mint` function is not private, it can be called by anyone, including an attacker who can front-run the constructor call and mint tokens to their own address before the intended recipient.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nOne solution to transaction-ordering dependence is to use a commit-reveal scheme in the case of information being submitted on-chain. This works by having the submittor send in a hash of the information, storing that on-chain along with the user address so that they may later reveal the answer along with the salt to prove that they were indeed correct. Another solution is to simply use a private mempool such as Flashbots.\n\nIn this case, the vulnerability can be mitigated by making the `_mint` function private and calling it only from trusted functions. Alternatively, the `_mint` function can be modified to accept a recipient address as an argument, instead of minting tokens to the `msg.sender` directly.\n\n### References\n\n- https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/#front-running-aka-transaction-ordering-dependence\n- https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/papers/2019_wtsc_front.pdf\n- https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114"]]
