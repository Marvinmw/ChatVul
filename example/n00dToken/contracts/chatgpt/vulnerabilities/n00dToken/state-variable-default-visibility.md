[["state-variable-default-visibility", "\n\n## Report\nIn the given smart contract code, there are no vulnerabilities found.\n\nThe code follows the best practices and recommendations provided by the Solidity documentation and ConsenSys. The visibility of the state variables is explicitly declared as private, and the functions are also declared with the appropriate visibility. The code also uses the `Address` library to check the validity of the addresses, which is a good practice.\n\nTherefore, the code is safe from the vulnerability of State Variable Default Visibility."]]
