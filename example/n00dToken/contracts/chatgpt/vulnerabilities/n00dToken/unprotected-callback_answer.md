## Vulnerability Type: Unprotected Callback

The `n00dToken` contract inherits from the `ERC777` contract, which has a `_callTokensReceived` function that is a callback function. This function is called when tokens are received by a contract that implements the `ERC777TokensRecipient` interface. The problem is that this function is unprotected, which means that a malicious contract could execute arbitrary code when tokens are received.

```Solidity
function _callTokensReceived(
    address operator,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory userData,
    bytes memory operatorData,
    bool requireReceptionAck
) private {
    address implementer = _ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer(to, _TOKENS_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE_HASH);
    if (implementer != address(0)) {
        IERC777Recipient(implementer).tokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
    } else if (requireReceptionAck) {
        require(!to.isContract(), "ERC777: token recipient contract has no implementer for ERC777TokensRecipient");
    }
}
```

An attacker could create a malicious contract that implements the `ERC777TokensRecipient` interface and then receive tokens from the `n00dToken` contract. The `_callTokensReceived` function would then call the `tokensReceived` function in the attacker's contract, which could execute arbitrary code, including reentrancy attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the `_callTokensReceived` function should be protected with a reentrancy guard or the `ERC777._send` function should be used instead of `_callTokensReceived` to transfer tokens.
