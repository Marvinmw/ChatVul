[["unprotected-callback", "\n\n## Vulnerability Type: Unprotected Callback\n\nThe `n00dToken` contract inherits from the `ERC777` contract, which has a `_callTokensReceived` function that is a callback function. This function is called when tokens are received by a contract that implements the `ERC777TokensRecipient` interface. The problem is that this function is unprotected, which means that a malicious contract could execute arbitrary code when tokens are received.\n\n```Solidity\nfunction _callTokensReceived(\n    address operator,\n    address from,\n    address to,\n    uint256 amount,\n    bytes memory userData,\n    bytes memory operatorData,\n    bool requireReceptionAck\n) private {\n    address implementer = _ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer(to, _TOKENS_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE_HASH);\n    if (implementer != address(0)) {\n        IERC777Recipient(implementer).tokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);\n    } else if (requireReceptionAck) {\n        require(!to.isContract(), \"ERC777: token recipient contract has no implementer for ERC777TokensRecipient\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAn attacker could create a malicious contract that implements the `ERC777TokensRecipient` interface and then receive tokens from the `n00dToken` contract. The `_callTokensReceived` function would then call the `tokensReceived` function in the attacker's contract, which could execute arbitrary code, including reentrancy attacks.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `_callTokensReceived` function should be protected with a reentrancy guard or the `ERC777._send` function should be used instead of `_callTokensReceived` to transfer tokens."]]
