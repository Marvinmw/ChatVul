## Report
### Vulnerability Type: 
Arbitrary Jump with Function Type Variable

### Vulnerability Description:
The smart contract uses inline assembly in the `_callTokensToSend` function to call the `tokensToSend` function of the contract implementing the `ERC777TokensSender` interface. The function type variable `implementer` is assigned the value returned by the `_ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer` function. An attacker can exploit this by calling the `_ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer` function with a malicious contract address that implements the `ERC777TokensSender` interface and a function with the same signature as `tokensToSend`. This will cause the `implementer` variable to point to the malicious function, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially drain the contract funds.

### Example:
An attacker can create a malicious contract with the following code:
```
contract MaliciousContract {
    function tokensToSend(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData
    ) public {
        // malicious code here
    }
}
```
Then, the attacker can call the `_ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer` function with the following parameters:
```
_ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer(address(this), keccak256("ERC777TokensSender"), address(maliciousContractAddress));
```
This will cause the `implementer` variable in the `_callTokensToSend` function to point to the `tokensToSend` function of the malicious contract, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Recommendation:
To avoid this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid using inline assembly unless it is necessary and properly understood. In this case, it is recommended to use the `address.call` function instead of inline assembly to call the `tokensToSend` function. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the function type variable to execute arbitrary code.
