[["unencrypted-secrets", "\n\n## Vulnerability Report\n\n### Unencrypted Secrets\n\nThe new smart contract code does not contain any unencrypted secrets or sensitive information that can be exploited by attackers. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this type of vulnerability.\n\nThe code is safe from this vulnerability because it does not use any off-chain secrets, such as API keys, with Oracle calls. Additionally, it does not have any guessing games that rely on private variables to win Ether.\n\nOverall, the new smart contract code is safe from the Unencrypted Secrets vulnerability."]]
