## Vulnerability Report

### Incorrect Inheritance Order

The `n00dToken` contract inherits from `ERC777`, which itself inherits from `Context`, `IERC777`, and `IERC20`. The order of inheritance is correct, starting with the most general contract `Context` and ending with the most specific contract `IERC20`. Therefore, there are no issues with inheritance order in this code.

The code is not vulnerable to the Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability.

### Overall Conclusion
