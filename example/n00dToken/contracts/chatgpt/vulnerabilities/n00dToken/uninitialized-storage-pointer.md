[["uninitialized-storage-pointer", "\n\n## Vulnerability Type: Uninitialized Storage Pointer\n\nThe new smart contract code is not vulnerable to the Uninitialized Storage Pointer vulnerability. The `_balances`, `_totalSupply`, `_name`, `_symbol`, `_defaultOperatorsArray`, `_defaultOperators`, `_operators`, `_revokedDefaultOperators`, and `_allowances` variables are all initialized in the constructor. Additionally, the `_mint` and `_burn` functions initialize the `_totalSupply` and `_balances` variables respectively. Therefore, there are no uninitialized storage pointers in this code."]]
