## Vulnerability Type: Insufficient Gas Griefing

The new smart contract code is vulnerable to Insufficient Gas Griefing. The `_send` function in the `ERC777` contract can be used to transfer tokens from one address to another. The function is called by the `send` and `transfer` functions. The `_send` function calls the `_callTokensToSend` and `_callTokensReceived` functions, which in turn call the `tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived` functions respectively. These functions can be implemented by other contracts to perform additional actions when tokens are sent or received.

An attacker can use the `send` or `transfer` function to transfer tokens to a contract that has implemented the `tokensReceived` function. The attacker can then use just enough gas to execute the `tokensReceived` function, but not enough gas for the function to complete successfully. This will cause the transaction to fail, but the tokens will have already been transferred.

To prevent this vulnerability, the `ERC777` contract should require that the sender provides enough gas for the entire transaction to complete successfully. This can be done by adding a `require` statement at the beginning of the `_send` function to check that there is enough gas remaining for the transaction to complete. 

```Solidity
function _send(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory userData,
    bytes memory operatorData,
    bool requireReceptionAck
) internal virtual {
    require(from != address(0), "ERC777: transfer from the zero address");
    require(to != address(0), "ERC777: transfer to the zero address");
    require(gasleft() >= 2500, "ERC777: insufficient gas");
    address operator = _msgSender();
    _callTokensToSend(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
    _move(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
    _callTokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData, requireReceptionAck);
}
```

The `require(gasleft() >= 2500, "ERC777: insufficient gas");` statement ensures that there is enough gas remaining for the transaction to complete successfully. The value of 2500 is an estimate of the gas required for the function to execute. It is important to note that this value may need to be adjusted based on the specific implementation of the `_send` function and the gas requirements of the `tokensReceived` function.
