### Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy Attack

The provided smart contract code is free from any known vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code is not immune to reentrancy attacks. 

The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function is marked as `internal` and `virtual`, which means that it can be overridden by child contracts. If a child contract overrides this function and calls a function that can be called by an external contract, then it can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

To prevent reentrancy attacks, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be marked as `private` instead of `internal`. This will prevent child contracts from overriding it and ensure that it can only be called internally. Additionally, any external calls made within the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be made at the end of the function to prevent any reentrancy attacks. 

### Recommendation

To prevent reentrancy attacks, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be marked as `private` instead of `internal`. Additionally, any external calls made within the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be made at the end of the function to prevent any reentrancy attacks. 

```Solidity 
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
    address operator,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) private virtual {}
