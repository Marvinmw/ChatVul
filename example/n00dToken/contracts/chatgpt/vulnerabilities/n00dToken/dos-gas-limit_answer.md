## Vulnerability Report

### Gas Limit Vulnerability

The new smart contract code is not vulnerable to the gas limit vulnerability. The code does not contain any unbounded loops or operations that can cause the gas limit to be exceeded. The functions that involve loops, such as `_send` and `_move`, have a fixed number of iterations that depend on the input parameters. Therefore, the gas usage of these functions can be estimated and controlled by the caller.

### Block Stuffing Vulnerability

The new smart contract code is not vulnerable to the block stuffing vulnerability. The code does not contain any time-based actions that can be exploited by an attacker to fill several blocks with high gas price transactions. The functions that involve time-based actions, such as `_mint`, `_send`, and `_move`, do not depend on the block timestamp or block number. Therefore, the gas usage of these functions is not affected by the block congestion.

### Conclusion

The new smart contract code is not vulnerable to the gas limit or block stuffing vulnerabilities. The code follows the best practices for preventing denial-of-service attacks and can be considered secure.
