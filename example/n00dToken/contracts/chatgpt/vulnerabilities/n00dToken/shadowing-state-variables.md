[["shadowing-state-variables", "\n\n## Vulnerability Type: Shadowing State Variables\n\nIn the `n00dToken` contract, the `_name` and `_symbol` variables are defined again, even though they are already defined in the `ERC777` contract. This can lead to unintended side effects, as the value of `_name` and `_symbol` in `n00dToken` will override the value of `_name` and `_symbol` in `ERC777`. This can cause issues if any functionality in `ERC777` relies on the original values of `_name` and `_symbol`.\n\nTo avoid this vulnerability, it's important to avoid defining state variables with the same name in child contracts as in parent contracts. In this case, the `n00dToken` contract should not define `_name` and `_symbol` again, as they are already defined in `ERC777`.\n\n### Reference\n\n- https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-119"]]
