## Vulnerability Type: Unchecked Call Return Value

In the `_callTokensToSend` and `_callTokensReceived` functions, the return value of the `tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived` functions respectively is not checked. If the called function throws an error, the execution will continue, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially breaking the program logic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to further exploit the application.

```Solidity
function _callTokensToSend(
    address operator,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory userData,
    bytes memory operatorData
) private {
    address implementer = _ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer(from, _TOKENS_SENDER_INTERFACE_HASH);
    if (implementer != address(0)) {
        IERC777Sender(implementer).tokensToSend(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
    }
}

function _callTokensReceived(
    address operator,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory userData,
    bytes memory operatorData,
    bool requireReceptionAck
) private {
    address implementer = _ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer(to, _TOKENS_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE_HASH);
    if (implementer != address(0)) {
        IERC777Recipient(implementer).tokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
    } else if (requireReceptionAck) {
        require(!to.isContract(), "ERC777: token recipient contract has no implementer for ERC777TokensRecipient");
    }
}
```

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the called functions should be checked and handled appropriately.
