### Asserting EOA from Code Size

The new smart contract code does not contain any assertion of EOA from code size vulnerability.

The code is safe from this vulnerability because it does not use the code size of the sender to determine whether it is a contract or EOA. Therefore, there is no possibility of an attacker exploiting this vulnerability to bypass security measures.

### Conclusion

The new smart contract code is safe from the "Asserting EOA from Code Size" vulnerability.
