[["unclogged-blockchain-reliance", "\n\n### Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy Attack\n\nThe provided smart contract code is free from any known vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code is not immune to reentrancy attacks. \n\nThe `_beforeTokenTransfer` function is marked as `internal` and `virtual`, which means that it can be overridden by child contracts. If a child contract overrides this function and calls a function that can be called by an external contract, then it can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. \n\nTo prevent reentrancy attacks, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be marked as `private` instead of `internal`. This will prevent child contracts from overriding it and ensure that it can only be called internally. Additionally, any external calls made within the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be made at the end of the function to prevent any reentrancy attacks. \n\n### Recommendation\n\nTo prevent reentrancy attacks, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function should be marked as `private` instead of `internal`.
