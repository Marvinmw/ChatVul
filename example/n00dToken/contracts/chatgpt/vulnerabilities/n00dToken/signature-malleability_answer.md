## Report
The provided smart contract code is free of any vulnerabilities related to the Signature Malleability concept. The code is implementing the ERC777 token standard and inherits from the `ERC777` contract. The `ERC777` contract is a well-known and widely used implementation of the ERC777 token standard, and it has been audited and tested by many developers and security experts. Therefore, it is unlikely to contain any vulnerabilities related to the Signature Malleability concept.

However, it is important to note that the absence of vulnerabilities related to the Signature Malleability concept does not guarantee the absence of other vulnerabilities. Smart contracts are complex systems, and they can be vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a comprehensive security audit of the smart contract code to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.
