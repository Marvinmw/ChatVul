## Vulnerability Type: Timestamp Dependence

### Vulnerability Description

The smart contract code is not vulnerable to timestamp dependence as it does not use the `now` or `block.timestamp` variables to execute any contract functions. Therefore, there is no possibility of a miner manipulating the timestamp to their advantage.

### Recommendation
