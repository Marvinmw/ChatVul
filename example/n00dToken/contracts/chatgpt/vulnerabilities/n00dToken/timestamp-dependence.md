[["timestamp-dependence", "\n\n## Vulnerability Type: Timestamp Dependence\n\n### Vulnerability Description\n\nThe smart contract code is not vulnerable to timestamp dependence as it does not use the `now` or `block.timestamp` variables to execute any contract functions. Therefore, there is no possibility of a miner manipulating the timestamp to their advantage.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nN/A"]]
